# Dataset Cleaning Using EDA

This project is based on Exploratory Data Analysis, which means making it ready for the model building. This process take 70% of the time while dealing with the data.This includes handling outliers, missing value treatment, imbalance data treatment, feature scaling and engineering, etc.


## ðŸ›  Skills
Packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, automatic EDA


## Importing the libraries

import numpy as np

import pandas as pd

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

import seaborn as sns

import plotly

## Lesson Learned


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyze the data using visual techniques. It is used to discover trends, patterns, or to check assumptions with the help of statistical summary and graphical representations.

This helps the Data Scientist in building the models on the data
